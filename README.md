# EDA project DS Bootcamp
This is an EDA project for the Data Science Bootcamp @ The Bridge made by Antonio Leal

## Context and hypothesis
I have always been concerned about climate change and its consecuences, so when I found this temperature dataset on Kaggle I decided to use it for this project. At first, my hypotesis were to relate temperature changes with the human developement index (HDI) given for each country by the United Nations Organization. But, since that index has not direct relationship with the atmospherical phenomena, I decided to move into contamination, more particularly, to CO2 emissions, and check if the local temperature change can be correlated with the local CO2 emissions for each country.

## Data
I directly got the data in csv format from the following sources:</br>
		Temperature: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data</br>
		CO2 emission: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC</br>
  
Also, for the making of some map plots, I got an small csv document with the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of all the contries from:</br>
	  Coordinates: https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv
  
## Other info
A complete report can be found in the folder "documentation" of this repository.
